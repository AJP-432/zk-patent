**Secure your ideas the moment they're conceived. ZK-Patent uses AI, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and NFTs to create immutable, privacy-preserving timestamps for your intellectual property.**

## The Problem

When you have a groundbreaking idea, you want to establish proof of prior art without revealing the idea itself. Publicly disclosing details can jeopardize your ability to patent it later, while keeping it secret offers no protection against others claiming it first.

## The Solution

ZK-Patent solves this dilemma by leveraging the power of modern cryptography and blockchain technology.

1.  **AI-Powered Summarization**: An AI extracts the core essence of your uploaded document.
2.  **Zero-Knowledge Proof**: We generate a cryptographic proof that you possess this core idea _without ever revealing the idea itself_.
3.  **On-Chain Timestamp**: This proof is verified by a smart contract, which then mints an NFT to your wallet. This NFT serves as an immutable, publicly verifiable, yet private timestamp of your invention.

You can prove you had the idea at a specific time, without ever putting the idea on-chain. **Innovate, protect, publish ‚Äì faster than ever.**

## How It Works

1.  **Upload**: The user connects their wallet and uploads a document containing their idea.
2.  **Process (Backend)**:
    - The backend uses the Gemini API to summarize the document into its core concept.
    - It calculates a hash of this core concept using Poseidon hashing.
    - It uses **Circom** and **SnarkJS** to generate a ZK-SNARK proof, proving it knows the original concept for the given hash.
3.  **Verify & Mint (On-Chain)**:
    - The backend calls the `PatentNFT` smart contract with the user's address and the ZK proof.
    - The smart contract's embedded `Verifier` checks the proof's validity using on-chain verification.
    - If the proof is valid, the contract mints a new NFT to the user, permanently linking their address to the idea's unique hash.

## Smart Contract Architecture

The system consists of two main smart contracts deployed on Ethereum:

### 1. Verifier Contract (`Verifier.sol`)

- **Purpose**: Verifies ZK-SNARK proofs on-chain
- **Generated**: Automatically created from the Circom circuit using SnarkJS
- **Function**: `verifyProof(uint[2] _pA, uint[2][2] _pB, uint[2] _pC, uint[2] _pubSignals)`
- **Security**: Uses Groth16 proving system with precomputed verification keys
- **Gas Efficient**: Optimized assembly code for elliptic curve operations

```solidity
// Core verification function
function verifyProof(
    uint[2] calldata _pA,
    uint[2][2] calldata _pB,
    uint[2] calldata _pC,
    uint[2] calldata _pubSignals
) public view returns (bool)
```

### 2. PatentNFT Contract (`PatentNFT.sol`)

- **Purpose**: Main contract that mints NFTs after proof verification
- **Inherits**: ERC721 (NFT standard), Ownable (access control)
- **Key Features**:
  - Integrates with Verifier contract for proof validation
  - Maps each NFT to its corresponding idea hash
  - Emits events for tracking patent registrations
  - Only contract owner (backend minter) can mint NFTs

```solidity
// Main minting function with ZK proof verification
function mintWithProof(
    address to,
    uint256[2] memory a,
    uint256[2][2] memory b,
    uint256[2] memory c,
    uint256[2] memory input
) public onlyOwner
```

**Contract Flow:**

1. Backend generates ZK proof for user's idea
2. Backend calls `mintWithProof()` with proof parameters
3. PatentNFT calls Verifier to validate the proof
4. If valid, NFT is minted and idea hash is stored
5. `IdeaProven` event is emitted for indexing

## Zero-Knowledge Circuit Setup

This project relies on pre-compiled ZK-SNARK artifacts: a prover key (`.zkey`), a WebAssembly circuit (`.wasm`), and a Solidity verifier contract (`Verifier.sol`). Here is the high-level process used to generate them.

### 1. Write the Circuit

The core of the ZK logic is in `circuits/circuit.circom`. This circuit takes a private input (the `preimage` of the idea), computes its Poseidon hash, and exposes the resulting hash as a public output. This allows us to prove we know the `preimage` for a given public hash without revealing it.

### 2. Compile the Circuit

First, compile the `.circom` file. This generates the R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System) file, which is a mathematical representation of the circuit, and the `.wasm` file used for generating proofs.

```bash
# Create a directory for the output files
mkdir -p circuits/compiled

# Compile the circuit
circom circuits/circuit.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym -o circuits/compiled
```

### 3. Powers of Tau Ceremony (Phase 1)

To create a secure ZK-SNARK, we start with a "Powers of Tau" file from a trusted public ceremony. This is a universal setup that can be used for any circuit up to a certain size. We'll use a file that supports up to 2^20 constraints, which is more than sufficient.

```bash
# Download the .ptau file
curl -o circuits/powers_of_tau_28_hez_final_20.ptau https://hermez.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/powersOfTau28_hez_final_20.ptau
```

### 4. Generate the ZKey (Phase 2)

Next, we use `snarkjs` to create the initial prover key (`.zkey`) for our specific circuit using the `.ptau` file.

```bash
snarkjs groth16 setup circuits/compiled/circuit.r1cs circuits/powers_of_tau_28_hez_final_20.ptau circuits/compiled/circuit_0000.zkey
```

### 5. Contribute to the ZKey

For a production system, this `.zkey` would need multiple contributions from different parties to be secure. For this project, a single contribution is sufficient to finalize the key.

```bash
snarkjs zkey contribute circuits/compiled/circuit_0000.zkey circuits/compiled/circuit_final.zkey --name="zk-patent 1st contribution" -v -e="some random text for entropy"
```

### 6. Export the Verifier Contract

Finally, we export the verifier from our final `.zkey`. This generates a Solidity smart contract (`Verifier.sol`) that can verify proofs on-chain.

```bash
snarkjs zkey export solidityverifier circuits/compiled/circuit_final.zkey contracts/Verifier.sol
```

The generated `Verifier.sol` is then deployed, and its address is passed to the constructor of the main `PatentNFT.sol` contract. The `circuit_final.zkey` and `circuit.wasm` files are placed in `circuits/compiled/` for the backend to use when generating proofs.

## Security Considerations

- **Private Key Management**: The minter private key is stored securely and only used for transaction signing
- **ZK Circuit Security**: Circuit undergoes trusted setup ceremony for cryptographic security
- **Smart Contract Access Control**: Only authorized minter can mint NFTs
- **Proof Verification**: All proofs are verified on-chain before minting
- **Idea Privacy**: Original ideas never leave the user's device or backend processing
